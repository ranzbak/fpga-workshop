# Functions

This example shows how functions work in verilog.
Functions can have any number of inputs but only one output (one return value).

## Requirements

* Yosys
* Arachne-pnr
* Project IceStorm

## Usage

* ```make```

    Builds ```chip.bin``` bitstream

* ```make flash```

    Program the bitstream to the device.
